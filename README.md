## dotfiles of cheriimoya

Here are my dotfiles, use them as you like, improve them as you like, suggest improvements as you like, personalize them as you like.

### Setup

Never run code from the internet without checking what it does! *However, if you really want to install it automatically, run this:*

> **_Warning:_** the installer script is rather buggy, use it with care and backup your dotfiles first!! I am not responsible if the installer is not backing up your files!

```shell
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheriimoya/dotfiles/master/bootstrap-script.sh)"
```

### Bugs

I know there are some bugs but i am just too lazy to fix them. If you are really engaged, feel free to open an issue, i'll look into it.
